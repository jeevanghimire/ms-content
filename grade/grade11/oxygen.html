        <strong> Oxygen </strong> is the most abundant element in the earth crust. In the free state, it occurs as 
        diatomic molecule (o<sub>2</sub>) so called dioxygen, in the atmosphere of air. It constitutes about 20.9% 
        by volume or 23% by weight in air. In combined state, it occurs as metal ores in the form of oxides and 
        make up to 46.6% of earth crust.

         <h4>Hydrogen as fuel  </h4>  
             <p class="spacing3">Hydrogen is used as fuel in following forms:- </p>
         <ol class="list_loweralpha">  
            <li>Water gas which is mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (CO + H<sub>2</sub>) which is used for 
                generating large amount of heat in industries. </li>
            <li>Liquid hydrogen is used as source of fuel in rockets. </li>
            <li>Hydrogen fuel cell is used to convert hydrogen into electricity by reacting with oxygen in a 
                fuel cell when hydrogen is passed through anode and oxygen is passed through cathode. </li>
        </ol>


        <h4>Advantages of hydrogen fuel cell </h4>

    <h4>Heavy water</h4>
        <p class="spacing3">Heavy water was discovered by an American Chemist called Urey in 1932. He found that 
            6000 parts of Ordinary water contains one part of heavy water. Water molecule which consist of deuterium
            isotopes instats of protium is known as heavy water. It's chemical formula is D<sub>2</sub>0 
            and called deuterium oxide. It is prepared by prolonged electrolysis of water using nickel Electrode. </p>
          <h5>Uses of heavy water</h5>
          <ol class="list_loweralpha">
              <li>It is used as cooling agent in nuclear power plant.</li>
              <li>It is used as moderators to slow down the speed of nuclear reactions. </li>
          </ol>
     
     <h4    >Water as universal solvent</h4>   
         <p class="spacing">Water is considered as universal solvent as it dissolves much greater number of ionic 
             substance than any other liquid. It has a high dielectric constant of 82. The dissolution of ionic 
            compound takes place because of in-dipole interactions. Dissolution of molecular compounds such as 
            alcohols, sugar, urea etc. in water takes place because of tendency of this substances to form 
            hydrogen bonding with water molecule.  </p>

                 <p class="spacing">Ozone is produced in upper atmosphere (Stratosphere) in presence of
                    ultravoilet radiation (UV-rays). UV rays destroy oxygen molecule into nascent oxygen which
                    further react with molecular oxygen to give Ozone.
