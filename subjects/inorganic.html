        <strong> Hydrogen</strong> is the lightest and simplest element known since it has no neutron. It exists as 
        diatomic molecule so called dihydrogen. It's name 'hydrogen' was proposed by Antoine Lavasite
        (the father of modern chemistry) in 1817, as it produces water on burninig with oxygen (
        In Greek : 'hydro' means water and 'gene' means producer). In free state, it occurs in 
        <abbr title="a very small quantity, especially one too small to be accurately measured" tabindex="0">trace</abbr>
        amount  in the natural gases as well as in volcanic gases. The planets (jupiter, saturn, unanus), 
        sun and star of universe mostly contain hydrogen. Hydrogen constitutes 0.9% (by mass) of  the earth crust 
        and is the ninth element in the order of abundance in the earth.

<h3 class="subtitle">Periodic position of hydrogen</h3>
      <p class="hydrogen_electroconfig">  Since, the electronic configuration of hydrogen is 1S<sup>1 </sup>
 So, it is found in S-block within first period along group &#8544;A.  It is the first element of 
 periodic table.<br>
Hydrogen can gain one electron and act as electronegative element as well as it can lose one electron and act as electro-positive element.
So, <br>

    <p>Electronic configuration= 1S<sup>1</sup><br></span> </p>
    <p>Period = 1<sup>st</sup><br></p>

     <h5>Do you know?</h5>
<dt><strong>why is the position of hydrogen in periodic table considered <wbr> controversial <wbr>/anomalous ?</strong> </dt>
<dd> &rarr; Hydrogen is the first element in the modern periodic table. It has one electron in its K-shell. 
    On the basis of electronic configuration, Physical and Chemical properties, it can be placed either 
    in group IA along with alkali metals or in group VIIA along with halogens. Due to presence of one electron, 
    it has dual tendency either lose or gain one element.
    <p>
        <span>H - e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; H<sup>+</sup>(hydrogen ion) </span> <br>
        <span>H + e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; H<sup>-</sup>(hydride ion) </span>
    </p> 

    Thus, the position of hydrogen in the periodic table is controversial or anomalous. 
    
    <div class="img_box">
    <img src="../image/periodic-table.png"> </div>
    
    Hence,  hydrogen is usually shown on the left side of the period table on the top of alkali metals (group IA),
    to indicate its distance characters.

          Why is Orthohydrogen more stable than parahydrogen?</p>
         <p class="spacing3">&rarr; Orthohydrogen has greater bond dissociation energy than pararhydrogen. So, 
             more energy is required to break the bond between hydrogen molecule. So, Orthohydrogen is more 
            stable than Parahydrogen. </p>
